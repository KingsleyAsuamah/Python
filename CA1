#A shopping basket contains a number of line items, for example: eggs, rice, flour; each with a specific quantity. A basket may also have one discount code, for example eggs20. 
#The shop has a standard price list, as well as a set of currently valid discount codes, each of which confers a certain percentage discount for a list of eligible products.
#Produce a method which accepts a list of baskets, and outputs their values from highest to lowest.
